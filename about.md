This is a little bit about me.

I am a Senior SysAdmin in the public sector.  
  
Looking after 2 datacentres, managing a private cloud with over 100k users,
Office 365 tenancies, Azure IaaS, and now some Linux on AWS there's never a quiet day.  

Being primarily a Windows Admin, I have a lot of experience
with PowerShell and alot of my projects focus on scripts and automation.
